<h2>THE MORAL OF PUNCH.</h2>
<p>As we hope, gentle public, to pass many happy hours in your
society, we think it right that you should know something of our
character and intentions. Our title, at a first glance, may have
misled you into a belief that we have no other intention than the
amusement of a thoughtless crowd, and the collection of pence. We
have a higher object. Few of the admirers of our prototype, merry
Master PUNCH, have looked upon his vagaries but as the practical
outpourings of a rude and boisterous mirth. We have considered him
as a teacher of no mean pretensions, and have, therefore, adopted
him as the sponsor for our weekly sheet of pleasant instruction.
When we have seen him parading in the glories of his motley,
flourishing his baton (like our friend Jullien at Drury-lane) in
time with his own unrivalled discord, by which he seeks to win the
attention and admiration of the crowd, what visions of graver
puppetry have passed before our eyes! Golden circlets, with their
adornments of coloured and lustrous gems, have bound the brow of
infamy as well as that of honour&mdash;a mockery to both; as though
virtue required a reward beyond the fulfilment of its own high
purposes, or that infamy could be cheated into the forgetfulness of
its vileness by the weight around its temples! Gilded coaches have
glided before us, in which sat men who thought the buzz and shouts
of crowds a guerdon for the toils, the anxieties, and, too often,
the peculations of a life. Our ears have rung with the noisy
frothiness of those who have bought their fellow-men as beasts in
the market-place, and found their reward in the sycophancy of a
degraded constituency, or the patronage of a venal
ministry&mdash;no matter of what creed, for party <em>must</em>
destroy patriotism.</p>
<p>The noble in his robes and coronet&mdash;the beadle in his gaudy
livery of scarlet, and purple, and gold&mdash;the dignitary in the
fulness of his pomp&mdash;the demagogue in the triumph of his
hollowness&mdash;these and other visual and oral cheats by which
mankind are cajoled, have passed in review before us, conjured up
by the magic wand of PUNCH.</p>
<p>How we envy his philosophy, when SHALLA-BA-LA, that demon with
the bell, besets him at every turn, almost teasing the sap out of
him! The moment that his tormentor quits the scene, PUNCH seems to
forget the existence of his annoyance, and, carolling the
mellifluous numbers of <em>Jim Crow</em>, or some other strain of
equal beauty, makes the most of the present, regardless of the past
or future; and when SHALLA-BA-LA renews his persecutions, PUNCH
boldly faces his enemy, and ultimately becomes the victor. All have
a SHALLA-BA-LA in some shape or other; but few, how few, the
philosophy of PUNCH!</p>
<p>We are afraid our prototype is no favourite with the ladies.
PUNCH is (and we reluctantly admit the fact) a Malthusian in
principle, and somewhat of a domestic tyrant; for his conduct is at
times harsh and ungentlemanly to Mrs. P.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Eve of a land that still is Paradise,</p>
<p>Italian beauty!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But as we never look for perfection in human nature, it is too
much to expect it in wood. We wish it to be understood that we
repudiate such principles and conduct. We have a Judy of our own,
and a little Punchininny that commits innumerable improprieties;
but we fearlessly aver that we never threw him out of window, nor
belaboured the lady with a stick&mdash;even of the size allowed by
law.</p>
<p>There is one portion of the drama we wish was omitted, for it
always saddens us&mdash;we allude to the prison scene. PUNCH, it is
true, sings in durance, but we hear the ring of the bars mingling
with the song. We are advocates for the <em>correction</em> of
offenders; but how many generous and kindly beings are there pining
within the walls of a prison, whose only crimes are poverty and
misfortune! They, too, sing and laugh, and appear jocund, but the
<em>heart</em> can ever hear the ring of the bars.</p>
<p>We never looked upon a lark in a cage, and heard him trilling
out his music as he sprang upwards to the roof of his prison, but
we felt sickened with the sight and sound, as contrasting, in our
thought, the free minstrel of the morning, bounding as it were into
the blue caverns of the heavens, with the bird to whom the world
was circumscribed. May the time soon arrive, when every prison
shall be a palace of the mind&mdash;when we shall seek to instruct
and cease to punish. PUNCH has already advocated education by
example. Look at his dog Toby! The instinct of the brute has almost
germinated into reason. Man <em>has</em> reason, why not give him
intelligence?</p>
<p>We now come to the last great lesson of our motley
teacher&mdash;the gallows! that accursed tree which has its
<em>root</em> in injuries. How clearly PUNCH exposes the fallacy of
that dreadful law which authorises the destruction of life! PUNCH
sometimes destroys the hangman: and why not? Where is the divine
injunction against the shedder of man&rsquo;s blood to rest? None
<em>can</em> answer! To us there is but ONE disposer of life. At
other times PUNCH hangs the devil: this is as it should be. Destroy
the principle of evil by increasing the means of cultivating the
good, and the gallows will then become as much a wonder as it is
now a jest.</p>
<p>We shall always play PUNCH, for we consider it best to be merry
and wise&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;And laugh at all things, for we wish to know,</p>
<p>What, after all, are all things but a
show!&rdquo;&mdash;<em>Byron.</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As on the stage of PUNCH&rsquo;S theatre, many characters appear
to fill up the interstices of the more important story, so our
pages will be interspersed with trifles that have no other object
than the moment&rsquo;s approbation&mdash;an end which will never
be sought for at the expense of others, beyond the evanescent smile
of a harmless satire.</p>
<hr />
<h2>COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE.</h2>
<p>There is a report of the stoppage of one of the most respectable
<em>hard-bake</em> houses in the metropolis. The firm had been
speculating considerably in &ldquo;Prince Albert&rsquo;s
Rock,&rdquo; and this is said to have been the rock they have
ultimately split upon. The boys will be the greatest sufferers. One
of them had stripped hia jacket of all its buttons as a deposit on
some <em>tom-trot</em>, which the house had promised to supply on
the following day; and we regret to say, there are whispers of
other transactions of a similar character.</p>
<p>Money has been abundant all day, and we saw a half-crown piece
and some halfpence lying absolutely idle in the hands of an
individual, who, if he had only chosen to walk with it into the
market, might have produced a very alarming effect on some minor
description of securities. Cherries were taken very freely at
twopence a pound, and Spanish (liquorice) at a shade lower than
yesterday. There has been a most disgusting glut of tallow all the
week, which has had an alarming effect on dips, and thrown a still
further gloom upon rushlights.</p>
<p>The late discussions on the timber duties have brought the match
market into a very unsettled state, and Congreve lights seem
destined to undergo a still further depression. This state of
things was rendered worse towards the close of the day, by a large
holder of the last-named article unexpectedly throwing an immense
quantity into the market, which went off rapidly.</p>
<hr />
<h3>SOMETHING WARLIKE.</h3>
<p>Many of our readers must be aware, that in pantomimic pieces,
the usual mode of making the audience acquainted with anything that
cannot be clearly explained by dumb-show, is to exhibit a linen
scroll, on which is painted, in large letters, the sentence
necessary to be known. It so happened that a number of these
scrolls had Been thrown aside after one of the grand spectacles at
Astley&rsquo;s Amphitheatre, and remained amongst other lumber in
the property-room, until the late destructive fire which occurred
there. On that night, the wife of one of the
stage-assistants&mdash;a woman of portly dimensions&mdash;was
aroused from her bed by the alarm of fire, and in her confusion,
being unable to find her proper habiliments, laid hold of one of
these scrolls, and wrapping it around her, hastily rushed into the
street, and presented to the astonished spectators an extensive
back view, with the words, &ldquo;BOMBARD THE CITADEL,&rdquo;
inscribed in legible characters upon her singular drapery.</p>
<h3>HUME&rsquo;S TERMINOLOGY.</h3>
<p>Hume is so annoyed at his late defeat at Leeds, that he vows he
will never make use of the word Tory again as long as he lives.
Indeed, he proposes to expunge the term from the English language,
and to substitute that which is applied to, his own party. In
writing to a friend, that &ldquo;after the inflammatory character
of the oratory of the Carlton Club, it is quite supererogatory for
me to state (it being notorious) that all conciliatory measures
will be rendered nugatory,&rdquo; he thus expressed
himself:&mdash;&ldquo;After the inflamma<em>whig</em> character of
the ora<em>whig</em> of the nominees of the Carlton Club, it is
quite supereroga<em>whig</em> for me to state (it being
no<em>whig</em>ous) that all concilia<em>whig</em> measures will be
rendered nuga<em>whig</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>NATIVE SWALLOWS.</h3>
<p>A correspondent to one of the daily papers has remarked, that
there is an almost total absence of swallows this summer in
England. Had the writer been present at some of the election
dinners lately, he must have confessed that a greater number of
active swallows has rarely been observed congregated in any one
year.</p>
<h3>LORD MELBOURNE TO &ldquo;PUNCH.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>My dear PUNCH,&mdash;Seeing in the &ldquo;Court Circular&rdquo;
of the Morning Herald an account of a General Goblet as one of the
guests of her Majesty, I beg to state, that till I saw that
announcement, I was not aware of any other <em>general gobble
it</em> than myself at the Palace.</p>
<p>Yours, truly,<br />
MELBOURN</p>
<hr />
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2" name="page2"></a>[pg 2]</span>
<h3>A RAILROAD NOVEL</h3>
<p>DEAR PUNCH,&mdash;I was much amused the other day, on taking my
seat in the Birmingham Railway train, to observe a
sentimental-looking young gentleman, who was sitting opposite to
me, deliberately draw from his travelling-bag three volumes of what
appeared to me a new novel of the full regulation size, and with
intense interest commence the first volume at the title-page. At
the same instant the last bell rang, and away started our train,
whizz, bang, like a flash of lightning through a butter-firkin. I
endeavoured to catch a glimpse of some familiar places as we
passed, but the attempt was altogether useless. Harrow-on-the-Hill,
as we shot by it, seemed to be driving pell-mell up to town,
followed by Boxmoor, Tring, and Aylesbury&mdash;I missed Wolverton
and Weedon while taking a pinch of snuff&mdash;lost Rugby and
Coventry before I had done sneezing, and I had scarcely time to
say, &ldquo;God bless us,&rdquo; till I found we had reached
Birmingham. Whereupon I began to calculate the trifling progress my
reading companion could have made in his book during our rapid
journey, and to devise plans for the gratification of persons
similarly situated as my fellow-traveller. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo;
thought I, &ldquo;should literature alone lag in the age of steam?
Is there no way by which a man could be made to swallow Scott or
bolt Bulwer, in as short a time as it now takes him to read an
auction bill?&rdquo; Suddenly a happy thought struck me: it was to
write a novel, in which only the actual spirit of the narration
should be retained, rejecting all expletives, flourishes, and
ornamental figures of speech; to be terse and abrupt in
style&mdash;use monosyllables always in preference to
polysyllables&mdash;and to eschew all heroes and heroines whose
names contain more than four letters. Full of this idea, on my
returning home in the evening, I sat to my desk, and before I
retired to rest, had written a novel of three neat, portable
volumes; which, I assert, any lady or gentlemen, who has had the
advantage of a liberal education, may get through with tolerable
ease, in the time occupied by the railroad train running from
London to Birmingham.</p>
<p>I will not dilate on the many advantages which this description
of writing possesses over all others. Lamplighters, commercial
bagmen, omnibus-cads, tavern-waiters, and general postmen, may
&ldquo;read as they run.&rdquo; Fiddlers at the theatres, during
the rests in a piece of music, may also benefit by my invention;
for which, if the following specimen meet your approbation, I shall
instantly apply for a patent.</p>

<h3>LESSONS IN PUNMANSHIP.</h3>
<p>We have been favoured with the following announcement from Mr.
Hood, which we recommend to the earnest attention of our
subscribers:&mdash;</p>
<p>MR. T. HOOD, PROFESSOR OF PUNMANSHIP,</p>
<p>Begs to acquaint the dull and witless, that he has established a
class for the acquirement of an elegant and ready style of punning,
on the pure Joe-millerian principle. The very worst hands are
improved in six short and mirthful lessons. As a specimen of his
capability, he begs to subjoin two conundrums by Colonel
Sibthorpe.</p>
<p>COPY.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The following is a specimen of my punning <em>before</em>
taking six lessons of Mr. T. Hood:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Q. Why is a fresh-plucked carnation like a certain
<em>cold</em> with which children are affected?</p>
<p>&ldquo;A. Because it&rsquo;s <em>a new pink off</em> (an
hooping-cough).</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a specimen of my punning <em>after</em> taking
six lessons of Mr. T. Hood:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Q. Why is the difference between pardoning and thinking
no more of an injury the same as that between a selfish and a
generous man?</p>
<p>&ldquo;A. Because the one is <em>for-getting</em> and the other
<em>for-giving</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>N.B. Gentlemen who live by their wits, and diners-out in
particular, will find Mr. T. Hood&rsquo;s system of incalculable
service.</p>
<p>Mr. H. has just completed a large assortment of jokes, which
will be suitable for all occurrences of the table, whether dinner
or tea. He has also a few second-hand <em>bon mots</em> which he
can offer a bargain.</p>

<h2>A SYNOPSIS OF VOTING, ARRANGED ACCORDING TO THE CATEGORIES OF
&ldquo;CANT.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>There hath been long wanting a full and perfect Synopsis of
Voting, it being a science which hath become exceedingly
complicated. It is necessary, therefore, to the full development of
the art, that it be brought into such an exposition, as that it may
be seen in a glance what are the modes of bribing and influencing
in Elections. The briber, by this means, will be able to arrange
his polling-books according to the different categories, and the
bribed to see in what class he shall most advantageously place
himself.</p>
<p>It is true that there be able and eloquent writers greatly
experienced in this noble science, but none have yet been able so
to express it as to bring it (as we hope to have done) within the
range of the certain sciences. Henceforward, we trust it will form
a part of the public education, and not be subject tot he barbarous
modes pursued by illogical though earnest and zealous disciples;
and that the great and glorious Constitution that has done so much
to bring it to perfection, will, in its turn, be sustained and
matured by the exercise of what is really in itself so ancient and
beautiful a practice.</p>

<h2>THE PROFESSIONAL SINGER</h2>
<p>Have any of PUNCH&rsquo;S readers ever met one of the above
<em>genus</em>&mdash;or rather, have they not? They must; for the
race is imbued with the most persevering <em>hic et ubique</em>
powers. Like the old mole, these Truepennies &ldquo;work i&rsquo;
th&rsquo; dark:&rdquo; at the Theatres, the Opera, the Coal Hole,
the Cider Cellars, and the whole of the Grecian, Roman, British,
Cambrian, Eagle, Lion, Apollo, Domestic, Foreign, Zoological, and
Mythological Saloons, they &ldquo;most do congregate.&rdquo; Once
set your eyes upon them, once become acquainted with their habits
and manners, and then mistake them if you can. They are themselves,
alone: like the London dustmen, the Nemarket jockeys, the
peripatetic venders, or buyers of &ldquo;old clo&rsquo;,&rdquo; or
the Albert continuations at <em>one pound one</em>, they appear to
be <em>made to measure for the same</em>. We must now describe them
(to speak theatrically) with decorations, scenes, and properties!
The entirely new dresses of a theatre are like the habiliments of
the professional singer, i.e. neither one nor the other ever
<em>were entirely new</em>, and never will be allowed to grow
entirely old. The double-milled Saxony of these worthies is
generally <em>very</em> blue or <em>very</em> brown; the cut
whereof sets a man of a contemplative turn of mind wondering at
what precise date those tails were worn, and vainly speculating on
the probabilities of their being fearfully indigestible, as that
alone could to long have kept them from Time&rsquo;s remorseless
maw. The collars are always velvet, and always greasy. There is a
slight ostentation manifested in the seams, the stitches whereof
are so apparent as to induce the beholders to believe they must
have been the handiwork of some cherished friend, whose labours
ought not to be entombed beneath the superstructure. The
buttons!&mdash;oh, for a pen of steam to write upon those buttons!
They, indeed, are the aristocracy&mdash;the yellow turbans, the
sun, moon, and stars of the woollen system! They have nothing in
common with the coat&mdash;they are <em>on it</em>, and
that&rsquo;s all&mdash;they have no further communion&mdash;they
decline the button-holes, and eschew all right to labour for their
living&mdash;they announce themselves as &ldquo;the last new
fashion&rdquo;&mdash;they sparkle for a week, retire to their
silver paper, make way for the new comers, and, years after, like
the Sleeping Beauty, rush to life in all their pristine splendour,
and find (save in the treble-gilt aodication and their own
accession) the coat, the immortal coat, unchanged! The waistcoat is
of a material known only to themselves&mdash;a sort of nightmare
illusion of velvet, covered with a slight tracery of refined
mortar, curiously picked out and guarded with a nondescript
collection of the very greenest green pellets of hyson-bloom
gunpowder tea. The buttons (things of use in this garment) describe
the figure and proportions of a large turbot. They consist of two
rows (leaving imagination to fill up a lapse of the absent),
commencing, to all appearance, at the <em>small of the back</em>,
and reaching down even to the hem of the garment, which is
invariably a double-breasted one, made upon the good old dining-out
principle of leaving plenty of room in the victualling department.
To complete the catalogue of raiment, the untalkaboutables have so
little right to the name of drab, that it would cause a controversy
on the point. Perhaps nothing in life can more exquisitely
illustrate the Desdemona feeling of divided duty, than the portion
of manufactured calf-skin appropriated to the peripatetic purposes
of these gentry; they are, in point of fact, invariably that
description of mud-markers known in the purlieus of
Liecester-square, and at all denominations of
&ldquo;boots&rdquo;&mdash;great, little, red, and yellow&mdash;as
eight-and-sixpenny Bluchers. But the afore-mentioned drabs are
strapped down with such pertinacity as to leave the observer in
extreme doubt whether the Prussian hero of that name is their
legitimate sponsor, or the glorious Wellington of our own sea-girt
isle. Indeed, it has been rumoured that (as there never was a
<em>pair</em> of either of the illustrious heroes) these gentlemen,
for the sake of consistency, invariably perambulate in <em>one of
each</em>. We scarcely know whether it be so or not&mdash;we merely
relate what we have heard; but we incline to the <em>two
Bluchers</em>, <em>because</em> of the <em>eight-and-six</em>. The
only additional expense likely to add any emolument to the
<em>tanner&rsquo;s</em> interest (we mean no pun) is the immense
extent of sixpenny straps generally worn. These are described by a
friend of ours as belonging to the great class of <em>coaxers</em>;
and their exertions in bringing (as a nautical man would say) the
trowsers <em>to bear</em> at all, is worthy of notice. There is a
legend extant (a veritable legend, which emanated from one of the
fraternity who had been engaged three weeks at her Majesty&rsquo;s
theatre, as one of twenty in an unknown chorus, the chief
peculiarity of the affair being the close approximation of some of
his principal foreign words to &ldquo;Tol de rol,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Fal the ral ra&rdquo;), in which it was asserted, that from
a violent quarrel with a person in the grass-bleached line, the
body corporate determined to avoid any unnecessary use of that
commodity. In the way of wristbands, the malice of the above void
is beautifully nullified, inasmuch as the most prosperous
linen-draper could never wish to have less linen on hand. As we are
describing the <em>genus</em> in <em>black</em> and <em>white</em>,
we may as well state at once, <em>those</em> are the colours
generally casing the throats from whence their sweet sounds issue;
these <em>ties</em> are garnished with union pins, whose strong
<em>mosaic tendency</em> would, in the Catholic days of Spain (had
they been residents), have consigned them to the lowest dungeons of
the Inquisition, and favoured them with an exit from this breathing
world, amid all the uncomfortable pomp of an
<em>auto-da-fe</em>.</p>
<p>It is a fact on record, that no one of the body ever had a cold
in his head; and this peculiarity, we presume, exempts them from
carrying pocket-handkerchiefs, a superfluity we never witnessed in
their hands, though they indulge in snuff-boxes which assume the
miniture form of French plum-cases, richly embossed, with something
round the edges about as much in proportion to <em>the box</em> as
<em>eighteen insides</em> are to a small tax-cart. This testimonial
is generally (as the engraved inscription purports) given by
&ldquo;several gentlemen&rdquo; (who are, unfortunately, in these
instances, always anonymous&mdash;which circumstance, as they are
invariably described as &ldquo;admirers of talent,&rdquo; is much
to be regretted, and, we trust, will soon be rectified). We
believe, like the immortal Jack Falstaff, they were each born at
four o&rsquo;clock of the morning, with a bald head, and something
of a round belly; certain it is, they are universally thin in the
hair, and exhibit strong manifestation of obesity.</p>
<p>The further marks of identity consist in a ring very variously
chased, and the infallible insignia of a tuning-fork: without this
no professional singer does or can exist. The thing has been tried,
and found a failure. Its uses are remarkable and various: like the
&ldquo;death&rsquo;s-head and cross-bones&rdquo; of the pirates, or
the wand, globe, and beard of the conjuror, it is their sure and
unvarying sign. We have in our mind&rsquo;s eye one of the species
even now&mdash;we see him coquetting with the fork, compressing it
with gentle fondness, and then (that all senses may be called into
requisition) resting it against his eye-tooth to catch the proper
tone. Should this be the prelude to his own professional
performance, we see it returned, with a look of profound wisdom, to
the right-hand depository of the nondescript and imaginary velvet
double-breaster&mdash;we follow his eyes, till, with peculiar
fascination, they fix upon the far-off cornice of the most distant
corner of the smoke-embued apartment&mdash;we perceive the
extension of the dexter hand employed in innocent dalliance with
the well-sucked peel of a quarter of an orange, whilst the left is
employed with the links of what would be a watch-guard, <em>if</em>
the professional singer <em>had a watch</em>. We hear the three
distinct hems&mdash;oblivion for a moment seizes us&mdash;the
glasses jingle&mdash;two auctioneers&rsquo; hammers astonish the
mahogany&mdash;several dirty hands are brought in violent and noisy
contact&mdash;we are near a friend of the vocalist&mdash;our glass
of gin-and-water (literally warm without) empties itself over our
lower extremities, instigated thereto by the gymnastic performances
of the said zealous friend&mdash;and with an exclamation that, were
Mawworn present, would cost us a shilling, we find the professional
singer has concluded, and is half stooping to the applause, and
half lifting his diligently-stirred grog, gulping down the
&ldquo;creature comfort&rdquo; with infinite satisfaction.</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>&mdash;There goes the hammer again! (Rubins has a sinecure
compared to that fat man). &ldquo;A glee, gents!&mdash;a
glee!&rdquo;&mdash;Ah! there they are&mdash;three coats&mdash;three
collars&mdash;Heaven knows how many buttons!&mdash;three bald
heads, three stout stomachs, three mouths, stuffed with three
tuning-forks, nodding and conferring with a degree of mystery
worthy of three Guy Faux.&rdquo;&mdash;What is the subject?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&ldquo;<em>Hail</em> smi<em>lig</em>
<em>b</em>orn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good guess! By the way, the vulgar notion of
singing <em>ensemble</em> is totally exploded by these
gentry&mdash;each professional singer, as a professional singer,
sings his very loudest, in <em>justice to himself</em>; if his
brethren want physical power, that&rsquo;s no fault of
<em>his</em>, <em>he don&rsquo;t</em>. Professional singers indulge
in small portions of classic lore: among the necessary acquirements
is, &ldquo;Non nobis,&rdquo; &amp;c. &amp;c.; that is, they
consider they ought to know the airs. The words are generally
delivered as
follows:&mdash;<em>Don&mdash;dobis&mdash;do&mdash;by&mdash;de</em>.
A clear enunciation is not much cultivated among the clever in this
line.</p>
<p>In addition to the few particulars above, it may be as well to
mention, they treat all tavern-waiters with great respect, which is
more Christian-like, as the said waiters never return the
same&mdash;sit anywhere, just to accommodate&mdash;eat everything,
to prove they have no squeamish partialities&mdash;know to a
toothful what a bottom of brandy <em>should be</em>&mdash;the exact
quantity they may drink, free gratis, and the most likely victim to
<em>drop upon</em> for any further nourishment they may require.
Their acquirements in the musical world are rendered clear, by the
important information that &ldquo;Harry Phillips knows what
he&rsquo;s about&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Weber was up to a thing or
two.&rdquo; A <em>baritone</em> ain&rsquo;t the sort of thing for
tenor music: and when <em>they</em> sung with some man (nobody ever
heard of), they showed him the difference, and wouldn&rsquo;t
mind&mdash;&ldquo;A cigar?&rdquo; &ldquo;Thank you,
sir!&mdash;seldom smoke&mdash;put it in my
pocket&mdash;(<em>aside</em>) that makes a dozen! Your good health,
sir!&mdash;don&rsquo;t dislike cold, though I generally take it
warm&mdash;didn&rsquo;t mean that as a hint, but, since you
<em>have ordered it</em>, I&rsquo;ll give you a
toast&mdash;Here&rsquo;s&mdash;THE PROFESSIONAL SINGER!&rdquo;</p>
<p>FUSBOS.</p>

<h2>A CONVERSATION BETWEEN TWO HACKNEY-COACH HORSES.</h2>
<h3>KINDLY COMMUNICATED BY OUR DOG &ldquo;TOBY.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>DEAR SIR,&mdash;I was a-sitting the other evening at the door of
my kennel, thinking of the dog-days and smoking my pipe (blessings
on you, master, for teaching me that art!), when one of your
prospectuses was put into my paw by a spaniel that lives as pet-dog
in a nobleman&rsquo;s family. Lawk, sir! what misfortunes can have
befallen you, that you are obleeged to turn author?</p>
<p>I remember the poor devil as used to supply us with
<em>dialect</em>&mdash;what a face he had! It was like a
mouth-organ turned edgeways; and he looked as hollow as the big
drum, but warn&rsquo;t half so round and noisy. You can&rsquo;t
have dwindled down to that, sure<em>ly</em>! I couldn&rsquo;t bear
to see your hump and <em>pars pendula</em> (that&rsquo;s dog Latin)
shrunk up like dried almonds, and titivated out in msty-fusty
toggery&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure I couldn&rsquo;t! The very thought of
it is like a pound weight at the end of my tail.</p>
<p>I whined like any thing, calling to my missus&mdash;for you must
know that I&rsquo;ve married as handsome a Scotch terrier as you
ever see. &ldquo;Vixen,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s the poor
old governor up at last&mdash;I knew that Police Act would drive
him to something desperate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why he hasn&rsquo;t hung himself in earnest, and summoned
you on his inquest!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. T.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worse nor that,&rdquo; says I; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s turned
author, and in course is stewed up in some wery elevated apartment
during this blessed season of the year, when all nature is wagging
with delight, and the fairs is on, and the police don&rsquo;t want
nothing to do to warm &lsquo;em, and consequentially sees no harm
in a muster of infantry in bye-streets. It&rsquo;s very
hawful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vixen sighed and scratched her ear with her right leg, so I
know&rsquo;d she&rsquo;d something in her head, for she always does
that when anything tickles her. &ldquo;Toby,&rdquo; says she,
&ldquo;go and see the old gentleman; perhaps it might comfort him
to larrup you a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be off at
once; so put me by a bone or two for supper, should any come out
while I&rsquo;m gone; and if you can get the puppies to sleep
before I return, I shall be so much obleeged to you.&rdquo; Saying
which, I toddled off for Wellington-street. I had just got to the
coach-stand at Hyde Park Corner, when who should I see labelled as
a waterman but the one-eyed chap we once had as a
orchestra&mdash;he as could only play &ldquo;Jim Crow&rdquo; and
the &ldquo;Soldier Tired.&rdquo; Thinks I, I may as well pass the
compliment of the day with him; so I creeps under the hackney-coach
he was standing alongside on, intending to surprise him; but just
as I was about to pop out he ran off the stand to un-nosebag a
cab-horse. Whilst I was waiting for him to come back, I hears the
off-side horse in the wehicle make the following remark:&mdash;</p>
<p>OFF-SIDE HORSE&mdash;(<em>twisting his tail about like
anything</em>)&mdash;Curse the flies!</p>
<p>NEAR-SIDE HORSE.&mdash;You may say that. I&rsquo;ve had one
fellow tickling me this half-hour.</p>
<p>OFF-SIDE HORSE.&mdash;Ours is a horrid profession! Phew! the sun
actually penetrates my vertebra.</p>
<p>NEAR-SIDE HORSE.&mdash;Werterbee! What&rsquo;s that?</p>
<p>OFF-SIDE HORSE&mdash;(<em>impatiently</em>).&mdash;The spine, my
friend (<em>whish! whish!</em>)</p>
<p>NEAR-SIDE HORSE.&mdash;Ah! it is a shameful thing to
<em>dock</em> us as they does. If the marrow in one&rsquo;s
backbone should melt, it would be sartin to run out at the tip of
one&rsquo;s tail. I say, how&rsquo;s your <em>feed?</em></p>
<p>OFF-SIDE HORSE.&mdash;Very indifferent&mdash;the chaff
predominates&mdash;(<em>munch</em>) not <em>bene</em> by any
means.</p>
<p>NEAR-SIDE HORSE.&mdash;Beany! Lord bless your ignorance! I
should be satisfied if they&rsquo;d only make it <em>oaty</em> now
and then. How long have you been in the hackney line?</p>
<p>OFF-SIDE HORSE.&mdash;I have occupied my present degraded
position about two years. Little thought my poor mama, when I was
foaled, that I should ever come to this.</p>
<p>NEAR-SIDE HORSE.&mdash;Ah! it ain&rsquo;t very respectable, is
it?&mdash;especially since the cabs and busses have druv over our
heads. What was you put to?&mdash;you look as if you had been well
brought up.</p>
<p>OFF-SIDE HORSE.&mdash;My mama was own sister to
<em>Lottery</em>, but unfortunately married a horse much below her
in pedigree. I was the produce of that union. At five years old I
entered the army under Ensign Dashard.</p>
<p>NEAR-SIDE HORSE&mdash;Bless me, how odd! I was bought at
Horncastle, to serve in the dragoons; but the wetternary man found
out I&rsquo;d a splint, and wouldn&rsquo;t have me! I say,
ain&rsquo;t that stout woman with a fat family looking at us?</p>
<p>OFF-SIDE HORSE.&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid she is. People of her
grade in society are always partial to a dilatory
shillingworth.</p>
<p>NEAR-SIDE HORSE&mdash;Ay, and always lives up Snow-hill, or
Ludgate-hill, or Mutton-hill, or a <em>hill</em> somewhere.</p>
<p>WOMAN.&mdash;Coach!</p>
<p>NEAR-SIDE HORSE.&mdash;She&rsquo;s ahailing us! I wonder whether
she&rsquo;s narvous? I&rsquo;ll let out with my hind leg a
bit&mdash;(<em>kick</em>)&mdash;O Lord! the rheumatiz!</p>
<p>OFF-SIDE HORSE.&mdash;Pray don&rsquo;t. I abjure subterfuges;
they are unworthy of a thoroughbred.</p>
<p>NEAR-SIDE HORSE.&mdash;Thoroughbred? I like that! Haven&rsquo;t
you just acknowledged that you were a cocktail? Thank God!
she&rsquo;s moving on. Hallo! there&rsquo;s old Readypenny!&mdash;a
willanous Tory.</p>
<p>OFF-SIDE HORSE.&mdash;I beg to remark that my principles are
Conservative.</p>
<p>NEAR-SIDE HORSE.&mdash;And I beg to remark that mine
isn&rsquo;t. I sarved Readypenny out at Westminster &lsquo;lection
the other day. He got into our coach to go to the poll, and I
wouldn&rsquo;t draw an inch. I warn&rsquo;t agoing to take up a
plumper for Rous.</p>
<p>OFF-SIDE HORSE.&mdash;I declare the obese female returns.</p>
<p>WOMAN.&mdash;Coach! Hallo! Coach!</p>
<p>WATERMAN.&mdash;Here you is, ma&rsquo;am. Kuck! kuck!
kuck!&mdash;Come along!&mdash;(<em>Pulling the coach and
horses</em>).</p>
<p>OFF-SIDE HORSE.&mdash;O heavens! I am too stiff to move, and
this brute will pull my head off.</p>
<p>NEAR-SIDE HORSE.&mdash;Keep it on one side, and you spiles his
purchase.</p>
<p>WATERMAN&mdash;Come up, you old brute!</p>
<p>OFF-SIDE HORSE.&mdash;Old brute! What evidence of a low
mind!&mdash;[<em>The stout woman and fat family ascend the steps of
the coach</em>].</p>
<p>COACH.&mdash;O law! oh, law! Week! week! O law!&mdash;O law!
Week! week!</p>
<p>NEAR-SIDE HORSE&mdash;Do you hear how the poor old thing&rsquo;s
a sufferin&rsquo;?&mdash;She must feel it a good deal to have her
squabs sat on by everybody as can pay for her. She was built by
Pearce, of Long-acre, for the Duchess of Dorsetshire. I wonder her
perch don&rsquo;t break&mdash;she has been crazy a long time.</p>
<p>WATERMAN.&mdash;Snow-hill&mdash;opposite the Saracen&rsquo;s
Head.</p>
<p>NEAR-SIDE HORSE.&mdash;I know&rsquo;d it!</p>
<p>COACHMAN.&mdash;Kuck! kuck!</p>
<p>WHIP.&mdash;Whack! whack!</p>
<p>OFF-SIDE HORSE.&mdash;Pull away, my dear fellow; a little extra
exertion may save us from flagellation.</p>
<p>NEAR-SIDE HORSE.&mdash;Well, I&rsquo;m pulling, ain&rsquo;t
I?</p>
<p>OFF-SIDE HORSE.&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like to dispute your word;
but&mdash;(<em>whack</em>)&mdash;Oh! that was an abrasion on my
shoulder.</p>
<p>NEAR-SIDE HORSE.&mdash;A <em>raw</em> you mean. Who&rsquo;s not
pulling now, I should like to know!</p>
<p>OFF-SIDE HORSE.&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t help hopping then; you
know what a <em>grease</em> I have in my hind leg.</p>
<p>NEAR-SIDE HORSE.&mdash;Well, haven&rsquo;t I a splint and a
corn, and ain&rsquo;t one of my fore fetlocks got a formoses, and
my hind legs the stringhalt?</p>
<p>WOMAN.&mdash;Stop! stop!</p>
<p>COACHMAN.&mdash;Whoo up!&mdash;d&mdash;n you!</p>
<p>OFF-SIDE HORSE.&mdash;There goes my last masticator!</p>
<p>NEAR-SIDE HORSE.&mdash;And I&rsquo;m blow&rsquo;d if he
hasn&rsquo;t jerked my head so that he&rsquo;s given me a crick in
the neck; but never mind; if she does get out here, we shall save
the hill.</p>
<p>WOMAN.&mdash;Three doors higher up.</p>
<p>COACHMAN.&mdash;Chuck! chuck!</p>
<p>WHIP.&mdash;Whack! whack!</p>
<p>COACHMAN.&mdash;Come up, you varmint!</p>
<p>OFF-SIDE HORSE&mdash;Varmint! and to me! the nephew of the great
Lottery! O Pegasus! what shall I come to next!</p>
<p>NEAR-SIDE HORSE.&mdash;Alamode beef, may be, or perhaps pork
sassages!</p>

<h3>A DRAMATIC DIALOGUE BETWEEN PUNCH AND HIS STAGE MANAGER.</h3>
<p>(<em>Enter</em> PUNCH.)</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;R-r-r-roo-to-tooit-tooit?</p>
<p>(<em>Sings.</em>)</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;Wheel about and turn about,</p>
<p class="i2">And do jes so;</p>
<p>Ebery time I turn about,</p>
<p class="i2">I jump Jim Crow.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>MANAGER.&mdash;Hollo, Mr. Punch! your voice is rather husky
to-day.</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;Yes, yes; I&rsquo;ve been making myself as hoarse
as a hog, bawling to the free and independent electors of Grogswill
all the morning. They have done me the honour to elect me as their
representative in Parliament. I&rsquo;m an M.P. now.</p>
<p>MANAGER.&mdash;An M.P.! Gammon, Mr. Punch.</p>
<p>THE DOG TOBY.&mdash;Bow, wow, wow, wough, wough!</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;Fact, upon my honour. I&rsquo;m at this moment an
unit in the collective stupidity of the nation.</p>
<p>DOG TOBY.&mdash;R-r-r-r-r-r&mdash;wough&mdash;wough!</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;Kick that dog, somebody. Hang the cur, did he never
see a legislator before, that he barks at me so?</p>
<p>MANAGER.&mdash;A legislator, Mr. Punch? with that wooden head of
yours! Ho! ho! ho! ho!</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;My dear sir, I can assure you that wood is the
material generally used in the manufacture of political puppets.
There will be more blockheads than mine in St. Stephen&rsquo;s, I
can tell you. And as for oratory, why I flatter my whiskers
I&rsquo;ll astonish them in that line.</p>
<p>MANAGER.&mdash;But on what principles did you get into
Parliament, Mr. Punch?</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;I&rsquo;d have you know, sir, I&rsquo;m above
having any principles but those that put money in my pocket.</p>
<p>MANAGER.&mdash;I mean on what interest did you start?</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;On self-interest, sir. The only great, patriotic,
and noble feeling that a public man can entertain.</p>
<p>MANAGER.&mdash;Pardon me, Mr. Punch; I wish to know whether you
have come in as a Whig or a Tory?</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;As a Tory, decidedly, sir. I despise the base,
rascally, paltry, beggarly, contemptible Whigs. I detest their
policy, and&mdash;</p>
<p>THE DOG TOBY.&mdash;Bow, wow, wough, wough!</p>
<p>MANAGER.&mdash;Hollo! Mr. Punch, what are you saying? I
understood you were always a staunch Whig, and a supporter of the
present Government.</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;So I was, sir. I supported the Whigs as long as
they supported themselves; but now that the old house is coming
down about their ears, I turn my back on them in virtuous
indignation, and take my seat in the opposition &lsquo;bus.</p>
<p>MANAGER.&mdash;-But where is your patriotism, Mr. Punch?</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;Where every politician&rsquo;s is, sir&mdash;in my
breeches&rsquo; pocket.</p>
<p>MANAGER.&mdash;And your consistency, Mr. Punch?</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;What a green chap you are, after all. A public
man&rsquo;s consistency! It&rsquo;s only a popular delusion, sir.
I&rsquo;ll tell you what&rsquo;s consistency, sir. When one
gentleman&rsquo;s <em>in</em> and won&rsquo;t come <em>out</em>,
and when another gentleman&rsquo;s <em>out</em> and can&rsquo;t get
<em>in</em>, and when both gentlemen persevere in their
determination&mdash;that&rsquo;s consistency.</p>
<p>MANAGER.&mdash;I understand; but still I think it is the duty of
every public man to&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;(<em>sings</em>)&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wheel about and turn about, And do jes so; Ebery time he
turn about, He jumps Jim Crow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MANAGER.&mdash;Then it is your opinion that the prospects of the
Whigs are not very flattering?</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;&rsquo;Tis all up with them, as the young lady
remarked when Mr. Green and his friends left Wauxhall in the
balloon; they haven&rsquo;t a chance. The election returns are
against them everywhere. England deserts them&mdash;Ireland fails
them&mdash;Scotland alone sticks with national attachment to their
backs, like a&mdash;</p>
<p>THE DOG TOBY.&mdash;Bow, wow, wow, wough!</p>
<p>MANAGER.&mdash;Of course, then, the Tories will take
office&mdash;?</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;I rayther suspect they will. Have they not been
licking their chops for ten years outside the Treasury door, while
the sneaking Whigs were helping themselves to all the fat tit-bits
within? Have they not growled and snarled all the while, and proved
by their barking that they were the fittest guardians of the
country? Have they not wept over the decay of our ancient and
venerable constitution&mdash;? And have they not promised and
vowed, the moment they got into office, that they would&mdash;Send
round the hat.</p>
<p>MANAGER.&mdash;Very good, Mr. Punch; but I should like to know
what the Tories mean to do about the corn-laws? Will they give the
people cheap food?</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;No, but they&rsquo;ll give them cheap drink.
They&rsquo;ll throw open the Thames for the use of the temperance
societies.</p>
<p>MANAGER.&mdash;But if we don&rsquo;t have cheap corn, our trade
must be destroyed, our factories will be closed, and our mills left
idle.</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;There you&rsquo;re wrong. Our tread-mills will be
in constant work; and, though our factories should be empty, our
prisons will be quite full.</p>
<p>MANAGER.&mdash;That&rsquo;s all very well, Mr. Punch; but the
people will grumble a <em>leetle</em> if you starve them.</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;Ay, hang them, so they will; the populace have no
idea of being grateful for benefits. Talk of starvation!
Pooh!&mdash;I&rsquo;ve studied political economy in a workhouse,
and I know what it means. They&rsquo;ve got a fine plan in those
workhouses for feeding the poor devils. They do it on the
homoeopathic system, by administering to them oatmeal porridge in
infinitessimal doses; but some of the paupers have such proud
stomachs that they object to the diet, and actually die through
spite and villany. Oh! &rsquo;tis a dreadful world for ingratitude!
But never mind&mdash;Send round the hat.</p>
<p>MANAGER.&mdash;What is the meaning of the sliding scale, Mr.
Punch?</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;It means&mdash;when a man has got nothing for
breakfast, he may slide his breakfast into his lunch; then, if he
has got nothing for lunch, he may slide that into his dinner; and
if he labours under the same difficulties with respect to the
dinner, he may slide all three meals into his supper.</p>
<p>MANAGER.&mdash;But if the man has got no supper?</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;Then let him wish he may get it.</p>
<p>MANAGER.&mdash;Oh! that&rsquo;s your sliding scale?</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;Yes; and a very ingenious invention it is for the
suppression of victuals. R-r-r-roo-to-tooit-tooit! Send round the
hat.</p>
<p>MANAGER.&mdash;At this rate, Mr. Punch, I suppose you would not
be favourable to free trade?</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;Certainly not, sir. Free trade is one of your
new-fangled notions that mean nothing but free plunder. I&rsquo;ll
illustrate my position. I&rsquo;m a boy in a school, with a bag of
apples, which, being the only apples on my form, I naturally sell
at a penny a-piece, and so look forward to pulling in a
considerable quantity of browns, when a boy from another form, with
a bigger bag of apples, comes and sells his at three for a penny,
which, of course, knocks up my trade.</p>
<p>MANAGER.&mdash;But it benefits the community, Mr. Punch.</p>
<p>PUNCH.&mdash;D&mdash;n the community! I know of no community but
PUNCH and Co. I&rsquo;m for centralization&mdash;and
individualization&mdash;every man for himself, and PUNCH for us
all! Only let me catch any rascal bringing his apples to my form,
and see how I&rsquo;ll cobb him. So now&mdash;send round the
hat&mdash;and three cheers for</p>

<h2>FINE ARTS.</h2>
<p>PUNCH begs most solemnly to assure his friends and the artists
in general, that should the violent cold with which he has been
from time immemorial afflicted, and which, although it has caused
his voice to appear like an infant Lablache screaming through
horse-hair and thistles, yet has not very materially affected him
otherwise&mdash;should it not deprive him of existence&mdash;please
Gog and Magog, he will, next season, visit every exhibition of
modern art as soon as the pictures are hung; and further, that he
will most unequivocally be down with his <em>coup de baton</em>
upon every unfortunate nob requiring his peculiar attention.</p>
<p>That he independently rejects the principles upon which these
matters are generally conducted, he trusts this will be taken as an
assurance: should the handsomest likeness-taker gratuitously offer
to paint PUNCH&rsquo;S portrait in any of the most favourite and
fashionable styles, from the purest production of the general
mourning school&mdash;and all performed by scissars&mdash;to the
exquisitely gay works of the President of the Royal Academy, even
though his Presidentship offer to do the nose with real carmine,
and throw Judy and the little one into the back-ground, PUNCH would
not give him a single eulogistic syllable unmerited. A word to the
landscape and other perpetrators: none of your little bits for
PUNCH&mdash;none of your insinuating cabinet gems&mdash;no
Art-<em>ful</em> Union system of doing things&mdash;Hopkins to
praise for one reason, Popkins to censure for another&mdash;and as
PUNCH has been poking his nose into numberless unseen corners, and,
notwithstanding its indisputable dimensions, has managed to screen
it from observation, he has thereby smelt out several pretty little
affairs, which shall in due time be exhibited and explained in
front of his proscenium, for special amusement. In the mean time,
to prove that PUNCH is tolerably well up in this line of
pseudo-criticism, he has prepared the following description of the
private view of either the Royal Academy or the Suffolk-street
Gallery, or the British Institution, for 1842, for the lovers of
this very light style of reading; and to make it as truly
applicable to the various specimens of art forming the collection
or collections alluded to, he has done it after the peculiar manner
practised by the talented conductor of a journal purporting to be
exclusively set apart to that effort. To illustrate with what
strict attention to the nature of the subject chosen, and what an
intimate knowledge of technicalities the writer above alluded to
displays, and with what consummate skill he blends those
peculiarities, the reader will have the kindness to attach the
criticism to either of the works (hereunder catalogued) most
agreeably to his fancy. It will be, moreover, shown that this is a
thoroughly impartial way of performing the operation of soft
anointment.</p>

<p>Should the friends of any of the artists deem the praise a
little too oily, they can easily add such a tag as the
following:&mdash;&ldquo;In our humble judgment, a little more
delicacy of handling would not be altogether out of place;&rdquo;
or, &ldquo;Beautiful as the work under notice decidedly is, we
recollect to have received perhaps as much gratification in viewing
previous productions by the same.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>FOR THE HALF CONDEMNED:</h3>
<p>This artist is, we much fear, on the decline; we no longer see
the vigour of handling and smartness of conception formerly
apparent in his works: or, &ldquo;A little stricter attention to
drawing, as well as composition, would render this artist&rsquo;s
works more recommendatory.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>THE TOTALLY CONDEMNED:</h3>
<p>Either of the following, taken conjointly or separately:
&ldquo;A perfect daub, possessing not one single quality necessary
to create even the slightest interest&mdash;a disgrace to the
Exhibition&mdash;who allowed such a wretched production to disgrace
these walls?&mdash;woefully out of drawing, and as badly
coloured,&rdquo; and such like.</p>

<h2>A COMMENTARY ON THE ELECTIONS.</h2>
<h3>BY THE BEADLE OF SOMERSET HOUSE.</h3>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Well, lawks-a-day! things seem going on uncommon queer,</p>
<p>For they say that the Tories are bowling out the Whigs almost
everywhere;</p>
<p>And the blazing red of my beadle&rsquo;s coat is turning to pink
through fear,</p>
<p>Lest I should find myself and staff out of Office some time
about the end of the year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done nothing so long but stand under the magnificent
portico</p>
<p>Of Somerset House, that I don&rsquo;t know what I should do if I
was for to go!</p>
<p>What the electors are at, I can&rsquo;t make out, upon my
soul,</p>
<p>For it&rsquo;s a law of natur&rsquo; that the <em>whig</em>
should be atop of the <em>poll</em>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a snug berth of it here for some time, and
don&rsquo;t want to cut the connexion;</p>
<p>But they <em>do</em> say the Whigs must go out, because
they&rsquo;ve NO OTHER ELECTION;</p>
<p>What they mean by that, I <em>don&rsquo;t</em> know, for
ain&rsquo;t they been electioneering&mdash;</p>
<p>That is, they&rsquo;ve been canvassing, and spouting, and
pledging, and ginning, and beering.</p>
<p>Hasn&rsquo;t Crawford and Pattison, Lyall, Masterman, Wood, and
Lord John Russell,</p>
<p>For ever so long been keeping the Great Metropolis in one
alarming <em>bussel</em>?</p>
<p>Ain&rsquo;t the two <em>first</em> retired into private
life&mdash;(that&rsquo;s the genteel for being rejected)?</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s more, the <em>last</em> four, strange to say,
have all been elected.</p>
<p>Then Finsbury Tom and Mr. Wakley, as wears his hair all over his
coat collar,</p>
<p>Hav&rsquo;n&rsquo;t they frightened Mr. Tooke, who once said he
could beat them <em>Hollar</em>?</p>
<p>Then at Lambeth, ain&rsquo;t Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Cabbell been
both on &lsquo;em bottled</p>
<p>By Mr. D&rsquo;Eyncourt and Mr. Hawes, who makes soap yellow and
mottled!</p>
<p>And hasn&rsquo;t Sir Benjamin Hall, and the gallant Commodore
Napier,</p>
<p>Made such a cabal with Cabbell and Hamilton as would make any
chap queer?</p>
<p>Whilst Sankey, who was backed by a <em>Cleave</em>-r for
Marrowbone looks cranky,</p>
<p>Acos the electors, like lisping babbies, cried out &ldquo;<em>No
Sankee?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then South&rsquo;ark has sent Alderman Humphrey and Mr. B.
Wood,</p>
<p>Who has promised, that if ever a member of parliament did his
duty&mdash;he would!</p>
<p>Then for the Tower Hamlets, Robinson, Hutchinson, and Thompson,
find that they&rsquo;re in the wrong box,</p>
<p>For the electors, though turned to Clay, still gallantly
followed the Fox;</p>
<p>Whilst Westminster&rsquo;s chosen Rous&mdash;not Rouse of the
Eagle&mdash;tho&rsquo; I once seed a</p>
<p>Picture where there was a great big bird, very like a
<em>goose</em>, along with a Leda.</p>
<p>And hasn&rsquo;t Sir Robert Peel and Mr. A&rsquo;Court been down
to Tamworth to be reseated?</p>
<p>They ought to get an act of parliament to save them such
fatigue, for its always&mdash;ditto repeated.</p>
<p>Whilst at Leeds, Beckett and Aldam have put Lord Jocelyn into a
considerable fume,</p>
<p>Who finds it no go, though he&rsquo;s added up the poll-books
several times with the calculating boy, Joe Hume.</p>
<p>So if there&rsquo;s been <em>no other election</em>, I should
like to find out</p>
<p>What all the late squibbing and fibbing, placarding, and
blackguarding, losing and winning, beering and ginning, and every
other <em>et cetera</em>, has been about!</p>

<h2>ON THE INTRODUCTION OF PANTOMIME INTO THE ENGLISH
LANGUAGE.</h2>
<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/001-05.png"><img src=
"images/001-05.png" alt="A man thumbing his nose" id="img001-05"
name="img001-05" width="25%" /></a></div>
<p>English&mdash;it has been remarked a thousand and odd
times&mdash;is one of the few languages which is unaccompanied with
gesticulation. Your veritable Englishman, in his discourse, is as
chary as your genuine Frenchman is prodigal, of action. The one
speaks like an oracle, the other like a telegraph.</p>
<p>Mr. Brown narrates the death of a poor widower from starvation,
with his hands fast locked in his breeches&rsquo; pocket, and his
features as calm as a horse-pond. M. le Brun tells of the
<em>debut</em> of the new <em>danseuse</em>, with several kisses on
the tips of his fingers, a variety of taps on the left side of his
satin waistcoat, and his head engulfed between his two shoulders,
like a cock-boat in a trough of the sea.</p>
<p>The cause of this natural diversity is not very apparent. The
deficiency of gesture on our parts may be a necessary result of
that prudence which is so marked a feature of the English
character. Mr. Brown, perhaps, objects to using two means to attain
his end when one is sufficient, and consequently looks upon all
gesticulation during conversation as a wicked waste of physical
labour, which that most sublime and congenial science of Pol. Econ.
has shown him to be the source of all wealth. To indulge in
pantomime is, therefore, in his eyes, the same as throwing so much
money in the dirt&mdash;a crime which he regards as second in
depravity only to that of having none to throw. Napoleon said, many
years back, we were a nation of shopkeepers; and time seems to have
increased, rather than diminished, our devotion to the ledger. Gold
has become our sole standard of excellence. We measure a
man&rsquo;s respectability by his banker&rsquo;s account, and mete
out to the pauper the same punishment as the felon. Our very
nobility is a nobility of the breeches&rsquo; pocket; and the
highest personage in the realm&mdash;her most gracious
Majesty&mdash;the most gracious Majesty of 500,000<em>l</em>. per
annum! Nor is this to be wondered at. To a martial people like the
Romans, it was perfectly natural that animal courage should be
thought to constitute heroic virtue: to a commercial people like
ourselves, it is equally natural that a man&rsquo;s worthiness
should be computed by what he is worth. We fear it is this
commercial spirit, which, for the reason before assigned, is
opposed to the introduction of pantomime among us; and it is
therefore to this spirit that we would appeal, in our endeavours to
supply a deficiency which we cannot but look upon as a national
misfortune and disgrace. It makes us appear as a cold-blooded race
of people, which we assuredly are not; for, after all our wants are
satisfied, what nation can make such heroic sacrifices for the
benefit of their fellow creatures as our own? A change, however, is
coming over us: a few pantomimic signs have already made their
appearance amongst us. It is true that they are at present chiefly
confined to that class upon whose manners politeness places little
or no restraint&mdash;barbarians, who act as nature, rather than as
the book of etiquette dictates, (and among whom, for that very
reason, such a change would naturally first begin to show itself:)
yet do we trust, by pointing out to the more refined portion of the
&ldquo;British public,&rdquo; the advantage that must necessarily
accrue from the general cultivation of the art of pantomime, by
proving to them its vast superiority over the comparatively tedious
operations of speech, and exhibiting its capacity of conveying a
far greater quantity of thought in a considerably less space of
time, and that with a saving of one-half the muscular
exertion&mdash;a point so perfectly consonant with the present
prevailing desire for cheap and rapid communication&mdash;that we
say we hope to be able not only to bring the higher classes to look
upon it no longer as a vulgar and extravagant mode of expression,
but actually to introduce and cherish it among them as the most
polite and useful of all accomplishments.</p>
<div class="figleft"><a href="images/001-06.png"><img src=
"images/001-06.png" alt="A man winking" id="img001-06" name=
"img001-06" width="100%" /></a></div>
<p>But in order to exhibit the capacities of this noble art in all
their comprehensive excellence, it is requisite that we should, in
the first place, say a few words on language in general.</p>
<p>It is commonly supposed that there are but two kinds of language
among men&mdash;the written and the spoken: whereas it follows,
from the very nature of language itself, that there must
necessarily be as many modes of conveying our impressions to our
fellow-creatures, as there are senses or modes of receiving
impressions in them. Accordingly, there are five senses and five
languages; to wit, the audible, the visible, the olfactory, the
gustatory, and the sensitive. To the two first belong speech and
literature. As illustrations of the third, or olfactory language,
may be cited the presentation of a pinch of Prince&rsquo;s Mixture
to a stranger, or a bottle of &ldquo;Bouquet du Roi&rdquo; to a
fair acquaintance; both of which are but forms of expressing to
them nasally our respect. The nose, however, is an organ but little
cultivated in man, and the language which appeals to it is,
therefore, in a very imperfect state; not so the gustatory, or that
which addresses itself to the palate. This, indeed, may be said to
be imbibed with our mother&rsquo;s milk. What words can speak
affection to the child like elecampane&mdash;what language assures
us of the remembrance of an absent friend like a brace of
wood-cocks? Then who does not comprehend the eloquence of dinners?
A rump steak, and bottle of old port, are not these to all guests
the very emblems of esteem&mdash;and turtle, venison, and
champagne, the unmistakeable types of respect? If the citizens of a
particular town be desirous of expressing their profound admiration
of the genius of a popular author, how can the sentiment be
conveyed so fitly as in a public dinner? or if a candidate be
anxious to convince the &ldquo;free and independent electors&rdquo;
of a certain borough of his disinterested regard for the
commonweal, what more persuasive language could he adopt than the
general distribution of unlimited beer? Of the sensitive, or fifth
and last species of language, innumerable instances might be
quoted. All understand the difference in meaning between cuffs and
caresses&mdash;between being shaken heartily by the hand and kicked
rapidly down stairs. Who, however ignorant, could look upon the
latter as a compliment? or what fair maiden, however simple, would
require a master to teach her how to construe a gentle compression
of her fingers at parting, or a tender pressure of her toe under
the dinner table?</p>
<p>Such is an imperfect sketch of the five languages appertaining
to man. There is, however, one other&mdash;that which forms the
subject of the present article&mdash;Pantomime, and which may be
considered as the natural form of the visible
language&mdash;literature being taken as the artificial. This is
the most primitive as well as most comprehensive, of all. It is the
earliest, as it is the most intuitive&mdash;the smiles and frowns
of the mother being the first signs understood by the infant.
Indeed, if we consider for a moment that all existence is but a
Pantomime, of which Time is the harlequin, changing to-day into
yesterday, summer into winter, youth into old age, and life into
death, and we but the clowns who bear the kicks and buffets of the
scene, we cannot fail to desire the general cultivation of an art
which constitutes the very essence of existence itself.
&ldquo;Speech,&rdquo; says Talleyrand, that profound political
pantomimist, &ldquo;was given to <em>conceal</em> our
thoughts;&rdquo; and truly this is the chief use to which it is
applied. We are continually clamouring for acts in lieu of words.
Let but the art of Pantomime become universal, and this grand
desideratum must be obtained. Then we shall find that candidates,
instead of being able, as now, to become legislators by simply
professing to be patriots, will be placed in the awkward
predicament of having first to <em>act</em> as such; and that the
clergy, in lieu of taking a tenth part of the produce for the mere
preaching of Christianity, will be obliged to sacrifice at least a
portion to charitable purposes, and <em>practise</em> it.</p>
<p>Indeed, we are thoroughly convinced, that when the manifold
advantages of this beautiful art shall be generally known, it
cannot fail of becoming the principle of universal communication.
Nor do we despair of ultimately finding the elegant Lord A. avowing
his love for the beautiful Miss B., by gently closing one of his
eyes, and the fair lady tenderly expressing that doubt and
incredulity which are the invariable concomitants of
&ldquo;Love&rsquo;s young dream,&rdquo; by a gentle indication with
the dexter hand over the sinister shoulder.</p>

<h3>AN ALLIGATOR CHAIRMAN.</h3>
<p>An action was recently brought in the Court of Queen&rsquo;s
Bench against Mr. Walter, to recover a sum of money expended by a
person named Clark, in wine, spirits, malt liquors, and other
refreshments, during a contest for the representation of the
borough of Southwark. One of the witnesses, who it appears was
chairman of Mr. Walter&rsquo;s committee, swore that <em>every
thing the committee had to eat or drink went through him.</em> By a
remarkable coincidence, the counsel for the plaintiff in this
tippling case was <em>Mr. Lush.</em></p>

<h2>THE DRAMA.</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;star system&rdquo; has added another victim to the
many already sacrificed to its rapacity and injustice. Mr. Phelps,
an actor whose personation of <em>Macduff</em>, the <em>Hunchback,
Jaques</em>, &amp;c., would have procured for him in former times
no mean position, has been compelled to secede from the Haymarket
Theatre from a justifiable feeling of disgust at the continual
sacrifices he was required to make for the aggrandisement of one to
whom he may not possibly ascribe any superiority of genius. The
part assigned to Mr. Phelps (<em>Friar Lawrence</em>) requires an
actor of considerable powers, and under the old
<em>r&eacute;gime</em> would have deteriorated nothing from Mr.
Phelps&rsquo; position; but we can understand the motives which
influenced its rejection, and whilst we deprecate the practice of
actors refusing parts on every caprice, we consider Mr.
Phelps&rsquo; opposition to this ruinous system of
&ldquo;starring&rdquo; as commendable and manly. The real cause of
the decline of the drama is the upholding of this system. The
&ldquo;stars&rdquo; are paid so enormously, and cost so much to
maintain them in their false position, that the manager cannot
afford (supposing the disposition to exist) to pay the working
portion of his company salaries commensurate with their usefulness,
or compatible with the appearance they are expected to maintain out
of the theatre; whilst opportunities of testing their powers as
actors, or of improving any favourable impression they may have
made upon the public, is denied to them, from the fear that the
influence of the greater, because more fortunate actor, may be
diminished thereby. These facts are now so well known, that men of
education are deterred from making the stage a profession, and
consequently the scarcity of rising actors is referable to this
cause.</p>
<p>The poverty of our present dramatic literature may also be
attributable to this absurd and destructive system. The
&ldquo;star&rdquo; must be considered alone in the construction of
the drama; or if the piece be not actually made to measure, the
actor, <em>par excellence</em>, must be the arbiter of the
author&rsquo;s creation. Writers are thus deterred from making
experiments in the higher order of dramatic writing, for should
their subject admit of this individual display, its rejection by
the &ldquo;star&rdquo; would render the labour of months valueless,
and the dramatist, driven from the path of fame, degenerates into a
literary drudge, receiving for his wearying labour a lesser
remuneration than would be otherwise awarded him, from the
pecuniary monopoly of the &ldquo;star.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is this system which has begotten the present indifference to
the stage. The public had formerly <em>many</em> favourites,
because all had an opportunity of contending for their
favour&mdash;now they have only Mr. A. or Mrs. B., who must
ultimately weary the public, be their talent what it may, as the
sweetest note would pall upon the ear, were it continually sounded,
although, when harmonised with others, it should constitute the
charm of the melody.</p>
<p>We have made these remarks divested of any personal
consideration. We quarrel only with the system that we believe to
be unjust and injurious to an art which we reverence.</p>

<p>We have seen Jullien, the elegant, pantomimic Jullien, exhibit

ago,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&ldquo;We met the daylight after
seven hours&rsquo; sitting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But we were not happy. There was a something that told us it was
not Vauxhall: the G R&rsquo;s were V R&rsquo;s&mdash;the cocked
hats were round hats&mdash;the fiddlers were foreigners&mdash;the
Rotunda was Astley&rsquo;s&mdash;the night was moon-shiny&mdash;and

gliding about amid an Eden of Houris, uttering to the verge of time
the hospitable sentence which has rendered thy name

<p>STRAND.&mdash;The enterprising managers of this elegant little
theatre have produced another mythological drama, called &ldquo;The
Frolics of the Fairies; or, the Rose, Shamrock, and Thistle,&rdquo;
from the pen of Leman Rede, who is, without doubt, the first of
this class of writers. The indisposition of Mr. Hall was stated to
be the cause of the delay in the production of this piece; out,
from the appearance of the bills, we are led to infer that it arose
from the <em>indisposition</em> of Mrs. Waylett to shine in the
same hemisphere with that little brilliant, Mrs. Keeley, and
&ldquo;a gem of the first water&rdquo; she proved herself to be on
Wednesday night. It would be useless to enter into the detail of
the plot of an ephemeron, that depends more upon its quips and
cranks than dramatic construction for its success. It abounds in
merry conceits, which that merriest of&mdash;dare we call her mere
woman?&mdash;little Mrs. Bob rendered as pointed as a Whitechapel
needle of the finest temper. The appointments and arrangements of
the stage reflect the highest credit on the management, and the
industry which can labour to surmount the difficulties which we
know to exist in the production of anything like scenic effect in
the Strand Theatre, deserve the encouragement which we were
gratified to see bestowed upon this little Temple of Momus.</p>

parliament for Westminster, as a logical curiosity, extracted from
a handbill very liberally distributed by Captain Rons&rsquo;s
party, during the late contest:&mdash;</p>
<p>1st. Because &ldquo;he is <em>brother to the Earl</em> of
Stradbroke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2nd. Because &ldquo;his <em>family</em> have always been hearty
Conservatives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3rd. Because &ldquo;they have been established in
<em>Suffolk</em> from the time of the
<em>Heptarchy</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4th. Because &ldquo;he entered the navy in 1808.&rdquo;</p>
<p>5th. Because &ldquo;he <em>brought home Lord Aylmer</em> in the
Pique, in 1835.&rdquo;</p>
<p>6th. Because &ldquo;he ran the Pique aground in the Straits of
Belleisle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>7th. Because &ldquo;after beating there for eleven hours, he got
her off again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>8th. Because &ldquo;he brought her into Portsmouth without a
rudder or forefoot, lower-masts all sprung, and leaking at the rate
of two feet per hour!&rdquo; ergo, he is the fittest man for the
representative of Westminster.&mdash;Q.E.D.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
